# TOPSIS Implementation using Python

## Objective
- Rank multiple alternatives using TOPSIS
- Analyze the impact of weights and criteria
- Visualize results for comparison

---

## Methodology
The TOPSIS algorithm follows these steps:
1. Normalize the decision matrix  
2. Apply weights  
3. Determine ideal best and worst solutions  
4. Compute Euclidean distances  
5. Calculate TOPSIS scores  
6. Rank alternatives  

---

## Results
- A result table is generated containing **TOPSIS Score** and **Rank**
- Higher TOPSIS score indicates a better alternative
- A bar graph is used to visualize score comparison

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
- GitHub

---

## How to Run
1. Open the Google Colab notebook  
2. Upload `data.csv`  
3. Run all cells sequentially  
4. View the result table and graph
